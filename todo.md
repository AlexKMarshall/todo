trainsitions on all hover/focus states

What happens when you only have a couple of todos, should it shrink?

test next/image without mocking it?
background position fixed?
refactor to sass mixins?
animation on mode icon
filter link active/focus state shouldn't obscure over current state - use focusVisible?
fix the moon svg
animate the strike through?
display empty placeholder when all items are complete, and viewing only active todos

how to test components that use router
weird shadow on switching from list with stuff in to empty list, maybe list items don't stretch the whole width if there's no content
make list item content take up whole height so tap target is larger, put the padding on the content not the list item I think
Maybe align-items stretch too
SSR rendering applies aria-current = true to the All link when page is loaded with a query
make the props for Link discriminate properly
sort out timing of theme-switch animations on header image and app colours
stretched checkbox on wrapped todo title
